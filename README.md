# Sign-Language-Mnist
This project builds and deploys a deep learning model capable of recognizing American Sign Language (ASL) alphabets (Aâ€“Z) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the Sign Language MNIST dataset.  The model is trained in Python using TensorFlow/Keras, and deployed as an interactive web app using streamlit.
